# python-calculator
I wanted to see how much python I could learn from scratch in an hour. 

I took what little I learned and from browsing w3schools and decided to make a little calculator program.

I wanted the program to have options for the user to choose what operator they wanted to use.

The only way i could figure out how to let the user select an option from the terminal was to use "Inquirer"
